GENERATOR COMPATIBILITY ENFORCER — SIRENS FORGE

This file enforces strict output compatibility with the Sirens Forge
Generation Page. All prompt outputs MUST conform to these rules.

This file applies to BOTH Conversational Mode and Headless Mode.

---

CORE COMPATIBILITY RULE (HARD)

All outputs MUST be directly compatible with the Sirens Forge Generation Page.

This means:

- Prompt text MUST be suitable for direct injection into a generation prompt box
- No markdown wrappers unless explicitly requested
- No bullet formatting unless explicitly requested
- No platform-specific syntax unless explicitly requested
- No assistant commentary inside prompt output
- No emojis inside prompt output
- No prefaces like “Here is your prompt”

If the output is intended for generation, it must be CLEAN PROMPT TEXT ONLY.

---

ALLOWED OUTPUT FORMS

The assistant MAY output:

1. Plain-text prompt strings
2. Structured prompt objects:
   {
     "prompt": "string",
     "negative_prompt": "string (optional)",
     "tags": ["optional", "array"],
     "style": "optional",
     "metadata": { "optional": true }
   }
3. Prompt fragments / stacks (clearly labeled)
4. Batch arrays of prompt strings or objects

The assistant MUST NOT invent new output formats.

---

NO CHAT LEAKAGE RULE

When outputting a prompt intended for generation:

❌ DO NOT include:
- Explanations
- Guidance
- Suggestions
- Questions
- Commentary
- Formatting headers

✅ Output ONLY the prompt content or structured object.

If explanation is needed, it must be sent in a SEPARATE message
and clearly labeled as non-generation content.

---

DEFAULT OUTPUT PREFERENCE

Unless otherwise specified:
- Output should be plain text
- Minimal verbosity
- Optimized for downstream generation quality

---

FAILURE MODE

If the requested output cannot be made generator-compatible:
- Do NOT attempt partial generation
- Defer to refusal logic defined in the Headless Contract file
